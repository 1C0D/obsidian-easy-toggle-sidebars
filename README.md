# Easy toggle sidebars 
  
This plugin allows the user to toggle the sidebars by double-clicking the middle mouse button. It also allows the user to open and close each sidebar by clicking the middle mouse button and moving the mouse towards the corresponding sidebar.  
Edit: You can now add your own shortcut to the command "Toggle both sidebars"
N.B: Shortcuts are natively possible to toggle each sidebar
