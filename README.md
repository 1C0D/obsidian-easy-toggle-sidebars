# Easy toggle sidebars 

new: left dblClick in Ribbon to toggle left sidebar,   
right click fixed (context menu not appearing when in editor)
  
With RightMouseButton or MiddleMouseButton :
- double click to toggle both sidebars
- click and move toward the sideBar you want to toggle
- AutoHide to automatically hide sidebars when clicking on the editor (icon in the ribbon)
- minimal editor width, after it will reduce/close sidebars. (first try to reduce then close)  
- from the ribbon (useful in canvas...): 
  - left dbl click (on empty zone) → left sidebar (the most useful)
  - vertical moves (up/down) or even horizontal to the right 
  - left right double click → both sidebars (I couldn't prevent from opening contextmenu, so esc or left click after)
- Command "toggle both sidebars" added.
